>>> UPDATE v1.0.11
- Detect console page as success after posting for reauth (thanks walterking)

>>> UPDATE v1.0.10
- fixed a stupid bug from previous update which broke re-auth. Sorry.

>>> UPDATE v1.0.9
- fixed bug for authentication with no existing role/credentials
- added an option to not show notification popup
- published to Github (https://github.com/gitlon/CASTER)

>>> WHY
AWS ADFS Federation (SAML) tokens have a maximum expiry of 1 hour.

Until Amazon change this limit, you are forced to re-login every 1 hour to use ADFS credentials for the AWS console and/or APIs. This is annoying.

This CASTER extension automates the re-login, as well as providing an indication of the time remaining until the current AWS credentials expire.

>>> HOW
- look at cookies from the AWS Console websites
- parse out the current user, role and expiry time
- when nearly expired, try to post to the specified ADFS URL to regenerate a SAML token
- then post again, to the common AWS SAML login page, to select the current AWS role
- if successful, the result is another credentialled-login for another 1 hour.

This only works if your credentials are saved - ie that you can navigate to your ADFS page and not be prompted for username and password after the first login.

>>> YOU (THE USER) MUST DO THIS
You MUST enter *your own* organisation's ADFS url, including the AWS role-provider. Eg:

- https://YOURADFS.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon?loginToRp=urn:amazon:webservices/

You should also review the default options.

>>> OPTIONS
- Attempt re-authentication as the current user/role?
- Show a Chrome notification before credentials are nearly expired?
- The URL for your organisation's ADFS endpoint
- When (minutes before) to change the icon time text to yellow
- When to change the icon time text to red
- When to show the Chrome notification
- When to attempt to re-authenticate

>>> WHY THESE PERMISSIONS
CASTER only needs permissions to two websites: your ADFS URL, and the standard AWS SAML role-choice page. Because you set your ADFS URL as an option, this can't be declared as a permission request. Therefore the extensions declares a request for "all websites". (This will be refined in a later version.)

>>> OTHER DETAILS
- What does CASTER mean?
  Chrome AWS SAML Token Expiry Reminder.

- I don't want you to steal my AWS or company passwords!?
  CASTER doesn't store any passwords, or collect or send any private data. It gathers from readily-accessible cookies, and reposts using credentials saved by your browser - in the same way that a user would. You can easily review the extension code to confirm that this is the case.

- Organization is spelled wrong in this text!?
  Not in Australia.

- This extension looks like it was written by some newbie that only just learned about Chrome Extensions and Javascript!!
  Yes.
